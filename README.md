# HW 1
Introduction to XR systems - homework 1 - the Room

This is the basis for the rest of the homeworks. Build has a cubic room which has a "planet" and an orbitting "moon" in the middle of the room. There is also a light at the center of the roof. The instructions for the controllers are on the wall in front of the player. The commands include the quit key, the light toggle and a way to break out of the room. 

Part 3: More interesting room

Outside of the room, I added a downloaded asset from TurboSquid, Shrek Toilet. I added the fbx-file and the texture folder into the Unity and set the asset outside of the room. I also used blender to create a simple fence which is also visible outside of the room. I added a free wood texture from freepik so that the fence would look like wood. The 3D model for the fence is quite short so multiple copies of the same model were used to create a longer fence.

# HW 2
Introduction to XR systems - homework 2 - The Scope and Grabbing

Used the room from homework 1. In this build, a magnifying glass has been added. You should be able to look through the magnifying lens and see a zoomed in picture. A hidden object is also added which can only be seen through the magnifying lens. You can grab the magnifying glass with either of the controllers or even both of the controllers at the same time. When both controllers are grabbing the magnifying glass, the tranlations and rotations of the controllers are combined into one.
