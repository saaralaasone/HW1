Introduction to XR systems  - homework 1 - the Room

This is the basis for the rest of the homeworks. Build has a cubic room which has a "planet" and an orbitting "moon" in the middle of the room. The instructions for the controllers are on the wall in front of the player. The commands include the quit key, the light toggle and a way to break out of the room.

Part 3: More interesting room
Outside of the room, I added a downloaded asset from TurboSquid (Shrek_Toilet.fbx). Added fbx-file and the texture folder into the Unity. I also used blender to create a simple fence which is also visible outside of the room. I added a free wood texture from freepik so that the fence would look like wood.
